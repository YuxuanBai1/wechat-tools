[中文](README_CN.md)

Welcome to wechat tools. If you like this project, feel free to visit our project repository（ https://github.com/YuxuanBai1/wechat-tools ）Clicking on a Star on the page indicates support for developers ~~(daily business)~~

###Before using this item, please first understand the ~~shortcomings~~ features of this project:

1. This project does not support automatic search for the user's WeChat location path;

2. This project has requirements for the resolution and scaling of the user's computer;

###Declaration feature:

The first point is that the functionality is too advanced, and I really can't do it (if you know this feature, you can submit Issues and attach code, but please be careful not to submit a large number of meaningless/repetitive Issues) ~~(also known as technical debt)~~

After reading the implementation principle, you will understand what is going on

###Implementation principle

This project code obtains WeChat text through system APIs and simulates user clicks, inputs, and other operations. So the optimal scaling ratio and resolution are 125% and 1920 X 1080
